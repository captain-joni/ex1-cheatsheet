Hello Stranger or Friend or maybe Frog (i dont judge),

Dante and myselfe texed a Cheatsheet for the 24/25 Ex-1 Lecture here in Heidelberg!

Feel free to use or get inspired by it, but be aware that writing your Cheatsheet yourself is a valuable learning technique. 

Nevertheless, this Cheatsheet will probably get updated until the Exam is over. If you spot a Mistake or fell that something very Important is missing, please open an Issue or text us via any other Method!

Have Fun! 

(The F in Physics stands for Fun!)
